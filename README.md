# Userscript-Python (Unfinished)

This is a PPCG community project. More about this in [PPCG UsErScRiPt chatroom](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/123103/userscript)

This is a python+flask port (Frontend is written with HTML).

Regular commits will be made. Anyone can add pull requests

4 steps are done:

1. HTML frontend
2. Flask server
3. Empty program FizzBuzz
4. User Clas (Still working on it, mostly done, user.py committed here)
